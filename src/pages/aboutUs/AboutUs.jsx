              <p className="indent-8">
                Tiger Golf Club, founded on October 8, 2012, started as a dream shared by a group of passionate golfers from all walks of life, including diplomats, expatriates, local business leaders, defense personnel, and professionals. Nestled in the heart of Dhaka, with renowned courses like Kurmitola Golf Club and Army Golf Club nearby, TGC was created to unite people who share a passion for golf. What began as an informal association has grown into an officially registered Limited Company as of October 12, 2020.
